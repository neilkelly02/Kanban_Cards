# Kanban_Cards
A Vue.js project inspired by Kanban Cards/Trello style project management apps.

This project was inspired by Trello, a Kanban Board style project management app that uses cards to represent tasks, and columns to represent categories of tasks.

By default, the project is loaded with sample data. These cards can be deleted through the app's GUI.
Alternatively, the boardData data parameter of the Vue object found in trello.js can be replaced with sampleEmptyBoard instead of sampleMinBoard.
